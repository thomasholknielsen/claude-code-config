# Markdownlint Ignore Patterns

# Spec-kit commands are intentionally excluded from linting
# These are stale files that should not be updated without explicit consent
# Per CLAUDE.md: "never allow changes to occur within the commands/spec kit folder without explicit consent"
commands/spec-kit/*.md

# Spec-kit workflow files (.specify folder)
# Feature specification and planning files managed by spec-kit workflow
.specify/**/*.md

# Research and temporary files
.claude/.research/**/*.md
