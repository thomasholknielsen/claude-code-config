# Feature Specification: Slash Command Template Standardization System

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i would like to add a template for slash commands. the temple should be placed in
project/templates/command.md and should contain a relevant template that slashcommands, when created in this repos should adhere to
for standardization. analyse the current commands to find important patterns for standardizations. finally the project/claude.md
shuld also direct claude to use this template when creating and modifying commands. perhaps we should also consider creating a
slashcomamnd for creating new slashcommands using the template.

while we do this we also need to finally ensure that all commands adhere to the template and also that allowed tools frontmatter
follows this synatx:

___
allowed-tools: Bash(git checkout --branch:*), Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git push:*), Bash(git commit:*),
Bash(gh pr create:*)
___"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract key requirements: template creation, standardization, CLAUDE.md updates, command creation tool
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: template location, frontmatter syntax standardization, CLAUDE.md integration, automation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [No major clarifications needed - requirements are explicit]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User creates new command using template
   ‚Üí User validates existing commands against template
   ‚Üí Claude references template when modifying commands
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Template creation with standardized sections
   ‚Üí Frontmatter syntax enforcement
   ‚Üí CLAUDE.md integration
   ‚Üí Optional command creation automation
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Template file structure
   ‚Üí Command frontmatter metadata
   ‚Üí CLAUDE.md configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
   ‚Üí No implementation details (focusing on WHAT, not HOW)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03

- Q: When updating existing commands to conform to the template, how should the system handle commands that have custom sections
  not in the standard template (e.g., workflow commands with orchestration details)? ‚Üí A: Flag for manual review - no automatic
  update; consider creating template variants for different command types
- Q: When a developer creates a new command without using the template, what validation or enforcement should occur? ‚Üí A: No
  validation - template is guidance only
- Q: When the template file itself is updated with new sections or changed requirements, how should those changes be applied to
  existing commands? ‚Üí A: No propagation - template updates apply to new commands only

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the Claude Code command system, I need a standardized template for creating and maintaining slash commands
so that all commands follow consistent patterns, include required metadata, and maintain quality standards across the repository.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer needs to create a new slash command, **When** they reference the template file, **Then** they have a
   complete structure showing all required sections (frontmatter, purpose, usage, process, agent integration, examples, integration
   points, quality standards)

2. **Given** an existing command lacks standardized frontmatter, **When** the command is updated to follow the template, **Then** it
   includes properly formatted `allowed-tools` syntax matching the pattern `Bash(command:*)` or specific tool names

3. **Given** Claude is creating or modifying a command, **When** it references CLAUDE.md project configuration, **Then** it is
   directed to use the standardized template located at `project/templates/command.md`

4. **Given** all commands in the repository, **When** validated against the template standard, **Then** each command adheres to the
   template structure with correct frontmatter syntax

5. **Given** a developer wants to automate command creation, **When** they use a potential command creation slash command, **Then** a
   new command file is generated pre-populated with the standardized template structure

### Edge Cases

- Commands with custom sections beyond the standard template MUST be flagged for manual review rather than automatically updated
- System SHOULD support template variants for different command types (e.g., workflow templates with orchestration sections)
- Template serves as guidance and best practice documentation; no automated validation or enforcement when developers create commands
- Template updates apply only to newly created commands; existing commands are not automatically updated when template changes
- How does the system handle commands with tool permissions that don't follow the `Bash(command:*)` pattern (e.g., MCP tools,
  specialized tools)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a standardized template file located at `project/templates/command.md` that defines the
  structure all slash commands should follow
- **FR-002**: Template MUST include sections for: frontmatter metadata, command name/title, purpose, usage with arguments, process
  steps, agent integration, examples, integration points, and quality standards
- **FR-003**: Template MUST specify required frontmatter fields: description, argument-hint, category, tools, complexity, and
  allowed-tools
- **FR-004**: Template MUST enforce `allowed-tools` frontmatter syntax using pattern: `allowed-tools: Tool1, Tool2, Bash(command:*),
  etc.`
- **FR-005**: CLAUDE.md project configuration MUST reference the template file and direct Claude to use it when creating or modifying
  commands
- **FR-006**: All existing commands in the repository MUST be updated to conform to the standardized template structure as a one-time
  migration, with commands containing custom sections flagged for manual review
- **FR-006a**: System SHOULD support template variants for different command types (e.g., base template, workflow template with
  orchestration sections)
- **FR-006b**: Future template updates apply only to newly created commands; existing commands are not automatically propagated with
  template changes
- **FR-007**: All existing commands MUST use the correct `allowed-tools` frontmatter syntax as specified in the template
- **FR-008**: System SHOULD provide a slash command (e.g., `/create:command`) for automated command creation using the template
  [OPTIONAL - marked for consideration]
- **FR-009**: Template MUST include clear examples showing how to document $ARGUMENTS parsing and usage patterns
- **FR-010**: Template MUST include guidance for documenting parallelization patterns where applicable
- **FR-011**: Template MUST specify how to document agent integration and specialist coordination

### Key Entities

- **Command Template File**: Markdown file at `project/templates/command.md` containing the standardized structure, section
  definitions, and frontmatter requirements that all slash commands must follow
- **Command Frontmatter**: YAML metadata block at the top of each command file containing: description, argument-hint, category,
  tools, complexity, and allowed-tools with specific syntax requirements
- **CLAUDE.md Configuration**: Project-level configuration file that must be updated to include references to the template and
  instructions for Claude to use it during command creation/modification
- **Existing Commands**: All 54 command files across 15 categories that must be validated and updated to conform to the template
  standard
- **Command Creation Automation** [OPTIONAL]: Potential slash command that generates new command files pre-populated with template
  structure
