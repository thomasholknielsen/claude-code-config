### Agent Capabilities

**Orchestrators:**

- **implementation-strategy-specialist**: Coordinates sequential code changes ensuring consistency
- **task-analysis-specialist**: Analyzes complexity and spawns appropriate specialized execution specialists
- **research-analysis-specialist**: Coordinates parallel information gathering across domains

**Workers:**

- **reviewer**: Performs parallel quality, security, and design checks
- **documenter**: Creates and maintains all forms of technical documentation
- **code-writer**: Focused code generation using structured operations
- **bug-fixer**: Specialized debugging and bug resolution
- **test-writer**: Test creation and maintenance using test-focused commands

### Documentation

- Comprehensive user guide with setup instructions
- Developer guide with architecture and extension patterns
- Agent Orchestra framework technical documentation
- Command template standards and examples
- Typical workflows with visual Mermaid diagrams
- Hooks system documentation with cross-platform patterns

### Security Features

- Git operation constraints (only `/git/*` commands can perform Git operations)
- Cross-platform Python-based hooks avoiding shell vulnerabilities
- User-agnostic design preventing hardcoded paths
- Agent responsibility isolation preventing privilege escalation
- MCP tool permission controls and restrictions

### Initial Release Notes

This initial release establishes the foundation for the Claude Code Command System, providing
a comprehensive automation framework for software development workflows. The system is designed with security,
cross-platform compatibility, and extensibility as core principles.

The Agent Specialist Framework enables sophisticated task coordination while maintaining clear separation of concerns. Each agent has a specific role and
responsibility, preventing overlap and ensuring efficient execution.

All commands follow standardized templates ensuring consistent user experience and
integration patterns. The documentation provides comprehensive guidance for both users and contributors.
