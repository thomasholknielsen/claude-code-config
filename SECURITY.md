# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

The Claude Code Command System implements comprehensive security controls to protect users and
their development environments. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security best practices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Core Security Principles

1. **Git Operation Constraints** - Only `/git/*` commands can perform Git operations
2. **Agent Isolation** - Clear separation of responsibilities prevents privilege escalation
3. **Cross-Platform Security** - Python-based implementation avoids shell vulnerabilities
4. **User-Agnostic Design** - No hardcoded user paths prevent unauthorized access
5. **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
6. **MCP Tool Restrictions** - External tool access is controlled and monitored

### Security Controls

**Git Operations:**

- Technical enforcement prevents unauthorized Git commands
- All agents must delegate Git operations via SlashCommand tool
- Git constraints are enforced at the execution layer

**File System Access:**

- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Access restricted to user's `.claude/` directory and project files
- No execution of arbitrary system commands

**Input Validation:**

- Command parameters are validated before execution
- User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- File paths are validated against allowed patterns

**External Tools:**

- MCP tool permissions are explicitly configured
- Context7 access limited to documentation retrieval
- Playwright browser automation has controlled scope

## üö® Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ‚úÖ Fully supported |
| Beta    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support |
| Alpha   | ‚ùå Not supported   |

## üîç Vulnerability Reporting

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### Reporting Process

**For security vulnerabilities:**

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** report privately using one of these methods:

**Email:** <security@claude-code.example.com>
**Subject:** [SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability

**Required Information:**

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours** - Initial acknowledgment of report
- **72 hours** - Initial assessment and severity classification
- **1 week** - Detailed investigation and fix development
- **2 weeks** - Fix testing and verification
- **4 weeks** - Public disclosure (after fix is released)

### Severity Classification

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**

- Remote code execution
- Unauthorized file system access outside allowed scope
- Credential exposure or theft
- Complete system compromise

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**

- Privilege escalation
- Unauthorized Git operations
- Data integrity compromise
- Partial system compromise

**Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**

- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Authentication bypass
- Configuration manipulation

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**

- Minor information leakage
- Local denial of service
- Non-security configuration issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Installation Security:**

- Download only from official sources
- Verify checksums when available
- Keep software updated to latest version
- Review configuration changes before applying

**Usage Security:**

- Use in trusted development environments only
- Review commands before execution
- Avoid running on production systems
- Monitor command execution logs

**Configuration Security:**

- Secure your `.claude/` directory appropriately
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regular backup of important configurations
- Review and understand permission settings

### For Contributors

**Development Security:**

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized commands
- Avoid hardcoded credentials or paths

**Code Review Security:**

- Security review required for all changes
- Static analysis tools must pass
- Manual security testing for security-sensitive changes
- Documentation of security implications

**Testing Security:**

- Test security controls thoroughly
- Verify input validation works correctly
- Test cross-platform security features
- Validate permission restrictions

## üîß Security Configuration

### Required Security Settings

**Path Restrictions:**

```python
# Example secure path handling
from pathlib import Path

def validate_safe_path(path_str):
    path = Path(path_str).resolve()
    claude_root = Path.home() / '.claude'
    if not path.is_relative_to(claude_root):
        raise SecurityError(f"Path outside allowed scope: {path}")
    return path
```text

**Git Operation Enforcement:**

```python
# Example Git constraint enforcement
def validate_git_operation(command, agent):
    if is_git_command(command) and not agent.startswith('git-'):
        raise SecurityError("Git operations only allowed via /git/* commands")
```

### MCP Tool Security

**Allowed Tools:**

- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Documentation ID resolution
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Documentation retrieval
- `mcp__playwright__*` - Browser automation (controlled scope)

**Blocked Patterns:**

- `mcp__*__filesystem` - Direct file system access
- `mcp__*__network` - Unrestricted network access
- `mcp__*__system` - System-level operations

## üìä Security Metrics

We track these security metrics:

- Git constraint violations
- Path traversal attempts
- Command injection attempts
- MCP tool usage anomalies
- Permission escalation attempts

## üöÄ Security Updates

**Update Process:**

1. Security fixes are prioritized above all other work
2. Critical security updates are released immediately
3. Users are notified through all available channels
4. Automated update mechanisms when possible

**Notification Channels:**

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with security sections
- Documentation updates
- Community announcements

## üìã Security Checklist

**For every release:**

- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Static analysis tools passed
- [ ] Manual security testing performed
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Configuration security validated
- [ ] Documentation updated with security implications

## üôè Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture. Responsible disclosure contributors will be:

- Credited in security advisories (with permission)
- Listed in our security hall of fame
- Eligible for recognition rewards (when available)
