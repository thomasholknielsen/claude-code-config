## Framework Structure (S-Tier Pattern)

### APE Framework (General Purpose)

**A**ction: Create Git Flow hotfix branch from main with validation (hotfix name required, descriptive, for CRITICAL issues only: security, production-breaking, payment failures, data loss), switch to main, pull latest, create hotfix/<name>, set up tracking, determine version bump (PATCH: v1.2.0 ‚Üí v1.2.1)

**P**urpose: Support emergency production fixes with proper Git Flow workflow (main ‚Üí hotfix ‚Üí merge to main AND develop), enforce PATCH version bumps only, provide emergency workflow checklist, warn non-critical issues should use feature branches

**E**xpectation: Hotfix branch created (hotfix/<name>) from production main, version suggestion provided (PATCH bump), emergency workflow checklist displayed, clear guidance for minimal changes only, dual merge reminder (main + develop)

## Critical Emergency Confirmed?

| Option | Action | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **A** | Confirm critical emergency | **‚Üê Recommended** |
| **B** | Use regular feature branch | For non-critical fixes |
| **C** | Review hotfix guidelines | Understand critical issue criteria |

Your choice (A/B/C):

## Next Steps

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1** | Reproduce and fix issue | Make minimal changes only |
| **2** | Test thoroughly | Run full test suite: `npm test` |
| **3** | Create emergency PR | Mark with `hotfix,critical` labels |
| **4** | Deploy immediately | Production deployment required after merge |

## Quality Standards (CARE)

**Target**: 85+ overall (Completeness >95% hotfix requirements, Accuracy >90% version determination, Relevance >85% emergency guidance, Efficiency <10s branch creation)

Create emergency hotfix branch: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Latest production tag: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 origin/main 2>/dev/null || echo "No tags on main"`
- Main branch status: !`git log main..origin/main --oneline 2>/dev/null | head -3 || echo "No remote tracking for main"`
- Commits on main since last tag: !`git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 origin/main 2>/dev/null)..origin/main --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' '`

## Task

Create a Git Flow hotfix branch for emergency production fixes:

### 1. Pre-Flight Validation

**Critical Checks:**

- **Verify hotfix name**: Ensure `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and descriptive
  - ‚úÖ Valid: `critical-security-patch`, `payment-gateway-fix`, `auth-bypass-fix`
  - ‚ùå Invalid: `fix`, `hotfix1`, `bug`
- **Check main branch exists**: Ensure `main` branch is present
- **Verify no uncommitted changes**: Clean working directory required
- **Confirm emergency status**: Hotfixes are for CRITICAL production issues only

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Hotfix Usage Guidelines**

Hotfixes are ONLY for:

- üîí Critical security vulnerabilities
- üí• Production-breaking bugs
- üí∞ Payment/transaction failures
- üö® Data loss or corruption issues
- üî• System downtime or crashes

NOT for:

- ‚ùå Regular bug fixes (use feature branch)
- ‚ùå New features (use feature branch)
- ‚ùå Performance improvements (use feature branch)
- ‚ùå Non-critical issues (wait for next release)

### 2. Create Hotfix Branch Workflow

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest production code
git pull origin main

# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout -b hotfix/$ARGUMENTS

# Set up remote tracking
git push -u origin hotfix/$ARGUMENTS
```

### 3. Determine Version Bump

Analyze the latest tag to suggest hotfix version:

```
Current production version: v1.2.0
Hotfix version: v1.2.1

Version bump: PATCH (third number incremented)
```

**Hotfix Version Rules:**

- Always increment PATCH version (X.Y.Z ‚Üí X.Y.Z+1)
- Never increment MAJOR or MINOR for hotfixes
- Examples:
  - v1.2.0 ‚Üí v1.2.1
  - v2.0.5 ‚Üí v2.0.6
  - v1.5.9 ‚Üí v1.5.10

### 4. Success Response

```
‚úì Switched to main branch
‚úì Pulled latest production code from origin/main
‚úì Created branch: hotfix/$ARGUMENTS
‚úì Set up remote tracking: origin/hotfix/$ARGUMENTS
‚úì Pushed branch to remote

üî• Hotfix Branch Ready: hotfix/$ARGUMENTS

Branch: hotfix/$ARGUMENTS
Base: main (production)
Will merge to: main AND develop
Suggested version: v1.2.1

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL HOTFIX WORKFLOW

This is an EMERGENCY production fix. Follow these steps:

1. üîç Identify the Issue
   - Reproduce the bug
   - Understand the root cause
   - Document the impact

2. üõ†Ô∏è Implement the Fix
   - Make MINIMAL changes
   - Focus ONLY on the critical issue
   - Avoid refactoring or improvements
   - Add tests to prevent regression

3. üß™ Test Thoroughly
   - Test the specific fix
   - Run full regression tests
   - Test on production-like environment
   - Verify no side effects

4. üìù Document the Fix
   - Update version in package.json
   - Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
   - Document the bug and fix
   - Include reproduction steps

5. üöÄ Deploy Process
   - Create PR to main
   - Get expedited review
   - Run /finish to merge and tag
   - Deploy to production immediately
   - Monitor for issues

üéØ Next Steps:
1. Fix the critical issue (MINIMAL changes only)
2. Test thoroughly: npm test
3. Update version: v1.2.1
4. Create emergency PR: gh pr create --label "hotfix,critical"
5. Get fast-track approval
6. Run /finish to merge to main AND develop
7. Deploy to production
8. Monitor systems closely

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember:
- Hotfix will be merged to BOTH main and develop
- Tag v1.2.1 will be created on main
- Production deployment should happen immediately
- Team should be notified of the hotfix
```

### 5. Error Handling

**No Hotfix Name Provided:**

```
‚ùå Hotfix name is required

Usage: /hotfix <hotfix-name>

Examples:
  /hotfix critical-security-patch
  /hotfix payment-processing-failure
  /hotfix auth-bypass-vulnerability

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Hotfixes are for CRITICAL production issues only!

For non-critical fixes, use:
  /feature <name> - Regular bug fixes
```

**Invalid Hotfix Name:**

```
‚ùå Invalid hotfix name: "fix"

Hotfix names should be:
- Descriptive of the issue
- Use kebab-case format
- Indicate severity/urgency

Examples:
  ‚úÖ critical-security-patch
  ‚úÖ payment-gateway-timeout
  ‚úÖ user-data-corruption-fix
  ‚ùå fix
  ‚ùå bug1
  ‚ùå hotfix
```

**Uncommitted Changes:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Uncommitted changes detected in working directory:
M  src/file.js
A  test.js

Hotfixes require a clean working directory.

Options:
1. Commit your changes first
2. Stash them: git stash
3. Discard them: git checkout .

‚ö†Ô∏è This is an emergency hotfix. Please clean your working directory.
```

**Main Branch Behind Remote:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Local main is behind origin/main by 2 commits

‚úì Pulling latest production code...
‚úì Fetched 2 commits
‚úì Main is now synchronized with production
‚úì Ready to create hotfix branch
```

**Not a Critical Issue:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Hotfix Confirmation Required

Is this a CRITICAL production issue that requires immediate attention?

Critical issues include:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Production system failures
- Data loss or corruption
- Payment/transaction failures

If this is NOT critical, consider:
- Creating a feature branch instead
- Waiting for the next release cycle
- Using regular bug fix workflow

Proceed with hotfix? [y/N]
```

## Git Flow Integration

**Hotfix Workflow in Git Flow:**

```
main (v1.2.0) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ (after hotfix merge) v1.2.1
                    ‚îÇ
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ hotfix/$ARGUMENTS
                         ‚îÇ
                         ‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∫ (merges back to both)
                             ‚îÇ
develop ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ (receives hotfix)
```

**Important:**

- Hotfixes branch from `main` (production)
- Hotfixes merge to BOTH `main` AND `develop`
- Tags are created on `main` after merge
- Production deployment happens immediately

## Environment Variables

- `GIT_FLOW_MAIN_BRANCH`: Main branch name (default: "main")
- `GIT_FLOW_DEVELOP_BRANCH`: Develop branch name (default: "develop")
- `GIT_FLOW_PREFIX_HOTFIX`: Hotfix prefix (default: "hotfix/")

## Related Commands

- `/finish` - Complete hotfix (merge to main and develop, create tag, deploy)
- `/flow-status` - Check current Git Flow status
- `/feature <name>` - Create feature branch (for non-critical fixes)
- `/release <version>` - Create release branch

## Best Practices

**DO:**

- ‚úÖ Use hotfixes ONLY for critical production issues
- ‚úÖ Keep changes minimal and focused
- ‚úÖ Test thoroughly before deploying
- ‚úÖ Document the issue and fix clearly
