# Git Flow Status

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS (START HERE)

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Read This BEFORE Proceeding

**What this command does:** Display comprehensive Git Flow status with branch type, sync status, and merge targets.

**YOU MUST:**
1. ✓ Detect current branch type (feature/release/hotfix/main/develop)
2. ✓ Show sync status (commits ahead/behind remote)
3. ✓ Display working directory changes (counts)
4. ✓ Determine merge targets
5. ✓ Show version info (current/next suggested)
6. ✓ List active branches

**YOU MUST NOT:**
- ✗ Do nothing silently
- ✗ Skip branch type detection
- ✗ Fail to show actionable recommendations

---

## IMPLEMENTATION FLOW

### Step 1: Analyze Current Branch
Detect type and sync status

### Step 2: Show Changes Summary
Display modified/added/deleted/untracked counts

### Step 3: Determine Merge Targets
Show where branch will merge

### Step 4: List Active Branches
Show Git Flow branches (feature/release/hotfix)

### Step 5: Show Recommendations
Display next steps (commit, push, finish, etc.)

---

## Framework Structure (S-Tier Pattern)

### APE Framework (General Purpose)

**A**ction: Display comprehensive Git Flow status with branch analysis (detect type: feature/release/hotfix/main/develop, show icon/color), sync status (commits ahead/behind remote), working directory changes (modified/added/deleted/untracked counts), merge target determination, version info (current production, next suggested), active branches list

**P**urpose: Provide complete Git Flow repository overview with branch type identification, actionable recommendations (commit, push, pull, finish), workflow suggestions (next commands), branch hygiene alerts (stale branches), clear understanding of current state before operations

**E**xpectation: Comprehensive status report with branch type visualization (icons: 🌿 feature, 🚀 release, 🔥 hotfix, 🏠 main, 🔀 develop), sync status alerts, working directory summary, merge target clarity, actionable recommendations prioritized, next steps guidance

## Quality Standards (CARE)

**Target**: 85+ overall (Completeness >95% status aspects, Accuracy >90% state detection, Relevance >85% recommendations, Efficiency <5s status display)

Display comprehensive Git Flow repository status

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Branch list: !`git branch -a | grep -E '(feature|release|hotfix|develop|main)' | head -20`
- Latest tags: !`git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline --graph --all -10`
- Remote status: !`git remote -v`

## Task

Provide a comprehensive Git Flow status report:

### 1. Branch Analysis

Determine current branch type and state:

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Detect branch type
if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == "main" ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🏠 Production"
  ICON="🏠"
  STATUS_COLOR="red"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == "develop" ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🔀 Integration"
  ICON="🔀"
  STATUS_COLOR="blue"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🌿 Feature"
  ICON="🌿"
  STATUS_COLOR="green"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == release/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🚀 Release"
  ICON="🚀"
  STATUS_COLOR="yellow"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == hotfix/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="🔥 Hotfix"
  ICON="🔥"
  STATUS_COLOR="red"
else
  BRANCH_TYPE="📁 Other"
  ICON="📁"
  STATUS_COLOR="gray"
fi
```

### 5. Recommendations

Provide actionable recommendations based on status:

```
💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

Priority Actions:
  1. ⚠️  Commit your 3 uncommitted changes
  2. ⚠️  Push 2 unpushed commits to remote
  3. ⚠️  Pull 1 commit from remote (behind)
  4. ℹ️  Run tests before finishing

Branch Hygiene:
  - 2 stale branches can be deleted
  - feature/mobile-app is 2 weeks old (consider splitting)
  - No merge conflicts detected ✓

Next Steps:
  1. Commit changes: git add . && git commit
  2. Pull updates: git pull
  3. Push commits: git push
  4. Run tests: npm test
  5. Finish when ready: /finish
```

### 6. Error States

**Not in Git Repository:**

```
❌ Not in a git repository

Initialize git repository:
  git init
  git remote add origin <url>

Or navigate to a git repository.
```

**No Git Flow Structure:**

```
⚠️  Git Flow structure not detected

Missing branches:
  - develop (integration branch)
  - main (production branch)

Initialize Git Flow:
  git flow init

Or create branches manually:
  git checkout -b develop
  git checkout -b main
```

**Remote Not Configured:**

```
⚠️  No remote repository configured

Add remote:
  git remote add origin <repository-url>

Verify remote:
  git remote -v
```

Repository maintenance:
  /clean-branches   - Clean up old branches
  git fetch --prune - Remove stale remote refs
```

## Related Commands

- `/feature <name>` - Create feature branch
- `/release <version>` - Create release branch
- `/hotfix <name>` - Create hotfix branch
- `/finish` - Complete current branch

## Best Practices

**Regular Status Checks:**

- ✅ Run /flow-status daily
- ✅ Check before starting new work
- ✅ Verify before finishing branches
- ✅ Monitor for stale branches

**Status Indicators:**

- ✓ Green: Good to proceed
- ⚠️ Yellow: Attention needed
- ✗ Red: Action required
- ℹ️ Blue: Informational
