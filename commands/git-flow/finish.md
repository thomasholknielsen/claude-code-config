# Git Flow Finish Branch

## Framework Structure (S-Tier Pattern)

### APE Framework (General Purpose)

**A**ction: Complete Git Flow branch with type detection (feature/release/hotfix), pre-merge validation (clean working directory, tests passing, no conflicts), merge to appropriate targets (feature ‚Üí develop, release/hotfix ‚Üí main + develop), create tags (release/hotfix only), delete branches (unless --no-delete), push all changes

**P**urpose: Automate Git Flow completion workflow with proper merge targets, enforce quality gates (tests, no conflicts), create version tags for releases/hotfixes, maintain dual merge for releases/hotfixes (main + develop), cleanup branches post-merge

**E**xpectation: Branch merged to correct targets, tags created for releases/hotfixes (--no-tag to skip), branches deleted locally and remotely (--no-delete to keep), post-finish checklist displayed, clear next steps (deploy for releases/hotfixes, continue work for features)

## Quality Standards (CARE)

**Target**: 85+ overall (Completeness >95% finish workflow, Accuracy >90% merge targets, Relevance >85% quality gates, Efficiency <30s typical finish)

Complete current Git Flow branch: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Current Repository State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Branch type: !`git branch --show-current | grep -oE '^(feature|release|hotfix)' || echo "Not a Git Flow branch"`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Unpushed commits: !`git log @{u}.. --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' '`
- Latest tag: !`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "No tags"`
- Test status: !`npm test 2>/dev/null | tail -20 || echo "No test command available"`

## Task

Complete the current Git Flow branch by merging it to appropriate target branch(es):

### 1. Branch Type Detection

Detect the current branch type and determine merge strategy:

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="feature"
  MERGE_TO="develop"
  CREATE_TAG="no"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == release/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="release"
  MERGE_TO="main develop"
  CREATE_TAG="yes"
  TAG_NAME="${CURRENT_BRANCH#release/}"
elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == hotfix/* ]]; then
  BRANCH_TYPE="hotfix"
  MERGE_TO="main develop"
  CREATE_TAG="yes"
  # Increment patch version from current tag
  CURRENT_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 origin/main 2>/dev/null)
  TAG_NAME="${CURRENT_TAG%.*}.$((${CURRENT_TAG##*.} + 1))"
else
  echo "‚ùå Not on a Git Flow branch (feature/release/hotfix)"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Pre-Merge Validation

Before merging, validate these conditions:

**Critical Checks:**

- ‚úÖ All changes are committed (no uncommitted files)
- ‚úÖ All commits are pushed to remote
- ‚úÖ Tests are passing (run test suite)
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts with target branch
- ‚úÖ Branch is up to date with remote

```
üîç Pre-Merge Validation

‚úì Working directory clean
‚úì All commits pushed to remote
‚úì Running tests...
  ‚îú‚îÄ Unit tests: 45/45 passed
  ‚îú‚îÄ Integration tests: 12/12 passed
  ‚îî‚îÄ All tests passed ‚úì

‚úì Checking for merge conflicts with develop...
  ‚îî‚îÄ No conflicts detected ‚úì

‚úì Branch is up to date with remote ‚úì

Ready to merge!
```

### 3. Feature Branch Finish

For **feature/** branches:

```bash
# Ensure all commits are pushed
git push

# Switch to develop
git checkout develop

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop

# Merge feature branch (no fast-forward)
git merge --no-ff feature/$NAME -m "Merge feature/$NAME into develop

$(git log develop..feature/$NAME --oneline)


# Push to remote
git push origin develop

# Delete local branch (unless --no-delete)
git branch -d feature/$NAME

# Delete remote branch (unless --no-delete)
git push origin --delete feature/$NAME
```

**Success Response:**

```
‚úì Pushed all commits to remote
‚úì Switched to develop
‚úì Pulled latest changes
‚úì Merged feature/$NAME into develop
‚úì Pushed to origin/develop
‚úì Deleted local branch: feature/$NAME
‚úì Deleted remote branch: origin/feature/$NAME

üåø Feature Complete!

Merged: feature/$NAME
Target: develop
Commits included: 5
Files changed: 12

üéâ Your feature is now in the develop branch!

Next steps:
- Feature will be included in next release
- Other team members can pull from develop
- You can start a new feature branch
```

### 4. Release Branch Finish

For **release/** branches:

```bash
# Extract version from branch name
VERSION="${CURRENT_BRANCH#release/}"

# Ensure all commits are pushed
git push

# Merge to main first
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/$VERSION -m "Merge release/$VERSION into main

Release notes:
$(cat CHANGELOG.md | sed -n "/## \[$VERSION\]/,/## \[/p" | head -n -1)


# Create tag on main (unless --no-tag)
git tag -a $VERSION -m "Release $VERSION

$(cat CHANGELOG.md | sed -n "/## \[$VERSION\]/,/## \[/p" | head -n -1)"

# Push main with tags
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff release/$VERSION -m "Merge release/$VERSION back into develop


# Push develop
git push origin develop

# Delete branches (unless --no-delete)
git branch -d release/$VERSION
git push origin --delete release/$VERSION
```

**Success Response:**

```
‚úì Pushed all commits to remote
‚úì Merged release/$VERSION into main
‚úì Created tag: $VERSION
‚úì Pushed main with tags
‚úì Merged release/$VERSION into develop
‚úì Pushed to origin/develop
‚úì Deleted local branch: release/$VERSION
‚úì Deleted remote branch: origin/release/$VERSION

üöÄ Release Complete: $VERSION

Merged to: main, develop
Tag created: $VERSION
Commits included: 15
Changes:
  - 5 features
  - 3 bug fixes
  - 2 performance improvements

üéâ Release $VERSION is now in production!

Next steps:
- Deploy to production: [deployment command]
- Monitor production for issues
- Announce release to team
- Update documentation if needed

Tag details:
  git show $VERSION
```

### 5. Hotfix Branch Finish

For **hotfix/** branches:

```bash
# Determine new version (patch bump)
CURRENT_VERSION=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 origin/main)
NEW_VERSION="${CURRENT_VERSION%.*}.$((${CURRENT_VERSION##*.} + 1))"

# Ensure all commits are pushed
git push

# Merge to main first
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/$NAME -m "Merge hotfix/$NAME into main

Critical fix for: $NAME


# Create tag on main (unless --no-tag)
git tag -a $NEW_VERSION -m "Hotfix $NEW_VERSION: $NAME

Critical production fix"

# Push main with tags
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/$NAME -m "Merge hotfix/$NAME back into develop


# Push develop
git push origin develop

# Delete branches (unless --no-delete)
git branch -d hotfix/$NAME
git push origin --delete hotfix/$NAME
```

**Success Response:**

```
‚úì Pushed all commits to remote
‚úì Merged hotfix/$NAME into main
‚úì Created tag: $NEW_VERSION (patch bump)
‚úì Pushed main with tags
‚úì Merged hotfix/$NAME into develop
‚úì Pushed to origin/develop
‚úì Deleted local branch: hotfix/$NAME
‚úì Deleted remote branch: origin/hotfix/$NAME

üî• Hotfix Complete: $NEW_VERSION

Merged to: main, develop
Tag created: $NEW_VERSION
Issue fixed: $NAME
Previous version: $CURRENT_VERSION

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Deploy to production immediately!

Next steps:
1. Deploy $NEW_VERSION to production NOW
2. Monitor production systems closely
3. Verify fix is working
4. Notify team of hotfix deployment
5. Update incident documentation

```
‚ùå Not on a Git Flow branch

Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH

/finish only works on:
- feature/* branches
- release/* branches
- hotfix/* branches

To finish this branch manually:
1. Switch to target branch
2. Merge manually: git merge $CURRENT_BRANCH
3. Push: git push
```

**Uncommitted Changes:**

```
‚ùå Cannot finish: Uncommitted changes detected

Modified files:
M  src/file1.js

    - should process payment (timeout)

Fix the failing tests before finishing:
1. Run tests: npm test
2. Fix failures
3. Commit fixes
4. Try /finish again

Skip tests? (NOT RECOMMENDED) [y/N]
```

**Merge Conflicts:**

```
‚ùå Merge conflict detected with develop

Conflicting files:
  src/config.js
  package.json

Resolution steps:
1. Fetch latest develop: git fetch origin develop
2. Try merge locally: git merge origin/develop
3. Resolve conflicts manually
4. Commit resolution
5. Try /finish again

Would you like to see conflict details? [Y/n]
```

**Missing Tag for Release:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Release branch missing version in CHANGELOG

Expected format in CHANGELOG.md:
## [v1.2.0] - 2025-10-01

Current CHANGELOG:

```

### 7. Arguments

**--no-delete**: Keep branch after merging

```bash
/finish --no-delete

# Merges but keeps local and remote branches
```

**--no-tag**: Skip tag creation (release/hotfix only)

```bash
/finish --no-tag

# Merges but doesn't create version tag
```

### 8. Interactive Confirmation

For destructive operations, ask for confirmation:

```
üîç Finish Summary
