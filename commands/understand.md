# Understand Project

I'll analyze your entire application to understand its architecture, patterns, and how everything works together.

**Phase 1: Project Discovery**
Using native tools for comprehensive analysis:
- **Glob** to map entire project structure
- **Read** key files (README, docs, configs)
- **Grep** to identify technology patterns
- **Read** entry points and main files

I'll discover:
- Project type and main technologies
- Architecture patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Directory structure and organization
- Dependencies and external integrations
- Build and deployment setup

**Phase 2: Code Architecture Analysis**
- **Entry points**: Main files, index files, app initializers
- **Core modules**: Business logic organization
- **Data layer**: Database, models, repositories
- **API layer**: Routes, controllers, endpoints
- **Frontend**: Components, views, templates
- **Configuration**: Environment setup, constants
- **Testing**: Test structure and coverage

**Phase 3: Pattern Recognition**
I'll identify established patterns:
- Naming conventions for files and functions
- Code style and formatting rules
- Error handling approaches
- Authentication/authorization flow
- State management strategy
- Communication patterns between modules

**Phase 4: Dependency Mapping**
- Internal dependencies between modules
- External library usage patterns
- Service integrations
- API dependencies
- Database relationships
- Asset and resource management

**Phase 5: Documentation Synthesis**
After analysis, I'll provide:
- **Architecture diagram** (in text/markdown)
- **Key components** and their responsibilities
- **Data flow** through the application
- **Important patterns** to follow
- **Tech stack summary**
- **Development workflow**

**Integration Points:**
I'll identify how components interact:
- API endpoints and their consumers
- Database queries and their callers
- Event systems and listeners
- Shared utilities and helpers
- Cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth)

**Output Format:**
```

When the analysis is large, I'll create a todo list to explore specific areas in detail.

This gives you a complete mental model of how your application works.
