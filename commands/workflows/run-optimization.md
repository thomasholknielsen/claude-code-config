# Run Optimization Workflow

I'll execute a comprehensive optimization workflow to improve performance, reduce bundle size, and enhance user experience.

## Optimization Pipeline

**Phase 1: Analysis**
1. `/analyze:performance` - Identify bottlenecks and slow operations
2. `/analyze:dependencies` - Find unused and outdated packages
3. `/test:coverage` - Ensure optimization safety

**Phase 2: Code Optimization**
4. `/fix:import-statements` - Optimize import patterns
5. `/clean:dead-code` - Remove unused code paths
6. `/operations:refactor-code-systematically` - Improve algorithmic efficiency

**Phase 3: Build Optimization**
7. `/build:application` - Optimize build configuration
8. Bundle analysis and code splitting recommendations
9. Asset optimization (images, fonts, static files)

**Phase 4: Validation**
10. `/test:performance` - Validate improvements
11. `/test:all` - Ensure no regressions
12. Performance benchmarking and reporting

Systematic optimization with measurable improvements.
