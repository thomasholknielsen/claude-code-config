# Complete Project Overhaul

I'll execute a comprehensive project overhaul by orchestrating all available workflows in intelligent sequence for maximum code improvement and quality assurance.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` - project scope, files, directories, or comprehensive flags with optional skip controls

## Complete Project Optimization

I'll coordinate all specialized workflows in strategic phases for systematic project improvement:

**Phase 1: Analysis & Assessment**
1. `/workflows:run-comprehensive-review` - Complete quality assessment (code, security, design)
2. `/workflows:run-security-audit` - Deep security vulnerability analysis

**Phase 2: Code Improvement**
3. `/workflows:run-cleanup-workflow` - Remove technical debt and clean codebase
4. `/workflows:run-refactor-workflow` - Systematic code restructuring

**Phase 3: Performance & Documentation**
5. `/workflows:run-optimization` - Performance improvements and bottleneck resolution
6. `/workflows:run-docs-workflow` - Documentation generation and updates

## Intelligent Orchestration

**Adaptive execution:**
- Analyze project to determine applicable workflows
- Skip irrelevant workflows (e.g., no documentation needed)
- Adjust sequence based on project type and current state
- Execute workflows in parallel where dependencies allow

**Scope handling:**
- No arguments: Comprehensive full-project optimization
- File/directory arguments: Focus all workflows on specified scope
- Multiple arguments: Process each scope systematically across all workflows

## Advanced Skip Controls

**Phase-level skips:**
- `--skip-analysis` - Skip review and security audit phases
- `--skip-improvement` - Skip cleanup and refactor phases
- `--skip-performance` - Skip optimization and documentation phases

**Workflow-specific skips:**
- `--skip-review` - Skip comprehensive review workflow
- `--skip-security` - Skip security audit workflow
- `--skip-cleanup` - Skip cleanup workflow
- `--skip-refactor` - Skip refactor workflow
- `--skip-optimization` - Skip optimization workflow
- `--skip-docs` - Skip documentation workflow

**Granular controls:**
- `--fast` - Use quick modes for all workflows
- `--thorough` - Use deep analysis modes for all workflows
- `--safe-mode` - Extra validation and git checkpoints
- `--parallel` - Maximum parallel execution where possible

## Execution Strategy

**Smart sequencing logic:**
1. **Analysis first** - Understand current state before changes
2. **Security early** - Identify critical issues before code changes
3. **Cleanup before refactor** - Remove technical debt first
4. **Refactor systematically** - Structured improvements on clean code
5. **Optimize last** - Performance improvements on well-structured code
6. **Document finally** - Generate docs for the improved codebase

**Dependency management:**
- Some workflows can run in parallel (review + security audit)
- Others must be sequential (cleanup → refactor → optimization)
- Intelligent batching for maximum efficiency

## Safety & Validation

**Comprehensive checkpointing:**
- Git commits between each major workflow
- Validate functionality after each phase
- Rollback capability if any workflow introduces failures
- Progress preservation for interrupted executions

**Quality gates:**
- Stop execution if critical security issues found
- Verify tests pass after each code-changing workflow
- Ensure build succeeds between phases
- Validate performance doesn't regress

## Progress Orchestration

**Unified tracking:**
- TodoWrite integration across all workflows
- Master progress dashboard
- Time estimation for complete execution
- Detailed reporting of all improvements made

**Workflow coordination:**
- Pass context between workflows
- Accumulate findings across all phases
- Generate comprehensive final report
- Provide actionable next steps

## Usage Examples

```
/workflows:run-master-workflow                    # Full project optimization
/workflows:run-master-workflow src/              # Focus on src directory
/workflows:run-master-workflow --skip-docs       # Skip documentation phase
/workflows:run-master-workflow --fast            # Quick mode for all workflows
/workflows:run-master-workflow --safe-mode       # Extra validation and checkpoints
/workflows:run-master-workflow UserService.ts --thorough  # Deep single file analysis
```

## Expected Comprehensive Outcomes

**Code quality transformation:**
- Comprehensive security audit with vulnerability fixes
- Eliminated duplication and technical debt
- Systematic refactoring with improved architecture
- Performance optimizations and bottleneck resolution
- Complete, up-to-date documentation

**Project health improvements:**
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Consistent code style and formatting
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Optimized performance metrics
- Maintainable, well-documented codebase

**Development experience enhancement:**
- Faster development cycles
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better code discoverability
- Improved team collaboration
- Reduced maintenance burden

The ultimate project overhaul command that transforms any codebase into a production-ready, maintainable, secure, and performant system through systematic workflow orchestration.
