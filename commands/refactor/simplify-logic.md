# Simplify Logic

I'll simplify complex conditionals, nested statements, and convoluted logic to make code more readable and maintainable.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` - files, functions, or specific logic blocks to simplify

## Logic Simplification Targets

**Complex conditionals:**
- Nested if-else chains
- Multiple boolean conditions
- Ternary operator overuse
- Switch statements with complex cases

**Control flow improvements:**
- Early returns to reduce nesting
- Guard clauses for input validation
- Loop simplification and optimization
- Exception handling streamlining

## Simplification Techniques

**Conditional optimization:**
- Replace nested ifs with early returns
- Extract complex boolean logic into named functions
- Use lookup tables instead of long if-else chains
- Simplify ternary operators for readability

**Structure improvements:**
- Flatten nested code blocks
- Combine related conditions
- Remove redundant checks
- Optimize loop structures

## Readability Focus

**Cognitive load reduction:**
- Reduce nesting levels
- Make code flow more linear
- Eliminate redundant logic
- Create clear, obvious code paths

**Maintainability improvements:**
- Easier to test individual logic branches
- Clearer error handling paths
- More obvious business logic flow
- Reduced complexity metrics

Quick logic simplification focused on immediate readability improvements.
