# Quick Refactor

I'll rapidly apply common refactoring patterns without session management overhead, perfect for daily code improvements.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` - files, code snippets, or specific improvements needed

## Common Quick Refactors

**Immediate improvements:**
- Extract magic numbers to named constants
- Simplify complex ternary operators
- Remove unused variables and imports
- Inline single-use variables
- Replace string concatenation with template literals

**Logic optimizations:**
- Convert if-else to early returns
- Simplify boolean expressions
- Replace repetitive code with loops
- Optimize array/object operations
- Streamline error handling

## Rapid Execution

**No session overhead:**
- Direct analysis and immediate changes
- Focus on obvious improvements
- Quick validation and testing
- Instant feedback on changes

**Pattern recognition:**
- Identify common anti-patterns
- Apply established refactoring techniques
- Use language-specific optimizations
- Follow project conventions automatically

## Quick Win Categories

**Readability improvements:**
- Better variable names for unclear identifiers
- Extract complex expressions into variables
- Add missing const/let corrections
- Simplify nested object access

**Performance optimizations:**
- Remove unnecessary array iterations
- Optimize conditional checks
- Eliminate redundant operations
- Improve memory usage patterns

**Code quality fixes:**
- Fix inconsistent formatting
- Remove console.log statements
- Add missing error handling
- Standardize similar code patterns

## Usage Examples

```
/refactor:quick "extract this magic number"
/refactor:quick UserCard.tsx
/refactor:quick "simplify these nested ifs"
/refactor:quick src/utils/
```

Fast, focused refactoring for immediate code quality improvements.
