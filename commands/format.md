# Auto Format Code

I'll format your code using the project's configured formatter.

I'll detect your project's formatter automatically by analyzing configuration files and project structure without assuming specific technologies.

I'll format only modified files to avoid unnecessary changes and focus on your current work.

If no formatter is configured, I'll suggest appropriate options for your project type and offer to format using language conventions.

After formatting, I'll show what changed and ensure the code follows your project's established style patterns.

If formatting encounters issues, I'll provide specific error details and suggest solutions.

This maintains consistent code style according to your project's standards efficiently.
