## üîß Style File Structure

Each style file follows this standard format:

```yaml
---
name: Style Name
description: Brief description of the style's purpose and approach
---
```

### Required Components

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata for style identification
2. **Communication Framework**: Core principles and methodologies
3. **Output Structure**: How responses should be formatted
4. **Specialized Vocabulary**: Domain-specific terminology
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Transparency in uncertainty levels

## üìÅ Installation & Management

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Create directory and copy all styles
mkdir -p ~/.claude/output-styles/
cp output-styles/*.md ~/.claude/output-styles/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/output-styles/
```

### Style Management Commands

```bash
# List available styles
/output-style

# Activate a style
/output-style [style-name]

# Return to default
/output-style default

# Check current style
/output-style status
```

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Single Style Session
Best for focused work requiring consistent professional perspective:
```bash
/output-style product-manager
# All responses now use product management framework
```

### Multi-Style Analysis
Gain multiple perspectives on the same problem:
```bash
# First, analyze from product perspective
/output-style product-manager
"How should we approach this feature?"

# Then, technical feasibility
/output-style system-administrator
"What infrastructure concerns exist?"

# Finally, user experience
/output-style ux-researcher
"What user research supports this?"
```

### Style Switching Workflow
```bash
/output-style data-scientist     # Analyze metrics
/output-style strategic-consultant  # Business implications
/output-style technical-writer    # Document findings
```

---
```

3. **Adapt communication framework**:

## üìà Performance Impact

### Token Efficiency
- **Average reduction**: 30-50% in response verbosity
- **Structured output**: Eliminates unnecessary explanations
- **Professional focus**: Direct, actionable communication

### Context Optimization
- **Single style**: Minimal context overhead (~200 tokens)
- **Style switching**: Clean transition without residual patterns
- **Custom styles**: Same performance as built-in styles

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Style not loading | Verify file exists in ~/.claude/output-styles/ |
| Inconsistent responses | Check YAML frontmatter formatting |
| Style not switching | Use exact style name from filename (without .md) |
| Custom style ignored | Ensure proper YAML structure and unique name |

### Validation Script

```bash
# Check all styles have valid YAML
for file in ~/.claude/output-styles/*.md; do
  head -n 5 "$file" | grep -q "^---" && echo "‚úì $(basename $file)" || echo "‚úó $(basename $file)"
done
```
