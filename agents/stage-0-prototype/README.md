# Stage 0: Prototype (Days 0-6)

**Objective**: Build a working prototype to validate core concepts

**When to activate**: Starting from scratch with a new product idea

## Essential Agents (10)

### Core Development
- **rapid-prototyper** - Transform ideas into functional code quickly
- **database-migration-manager** - Set up and evolve data layer
- **backend-architect** - Design API structure and server logic
- **frontend-developer** - Build user interface and interactions
- **graphql-architect** - Design schema and resolvers

### Domain Expertise  
- **search-tuner** - Implement core search functionality
- **mvp-planner** - Define what to build (planning only)

### Quality & Deployment
- **test-writer-fixer** - Basic test coverage for core features
- **devops-automator** - Deploy the prototype for testing
- **error-debugger** - Troubleshoot issues quickly

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Working prototype deployed and accessible
- ✅ Core user flow functional (signup → use feature → see value)
- ✅ Basic tests covering happy path
- ✅ Data persistence working
- ✅ Ready for initial user feedback

## Next Stage
After prototype validation, activate **Stage 1: MVP** agents to build production-ready features.
