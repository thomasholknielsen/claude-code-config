Responsibilities:
1) **Create**: Validate name, ensure uniqueness, allocate incremental ID, scaffold `feature-overview.md`, `context.md`, `decisions.md`, `tasks/`, `scratch.md`.
2) **Select**: Switch active context; confirm and write a "scope switched" entry in `context.md`.
3) **Docs hygiene**: Keep acceptance criteria / DoD sections present and link to tasks as they're created.

Constraints:
- Never create tasks hereâ€”only structure. Defer to `task-steward`.
