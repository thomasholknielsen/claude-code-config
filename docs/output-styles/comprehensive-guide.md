```text
You: Analyze our mobile app's user retention problem

Claude (Product Manager style):
**Problem Statement**: 30-day retention dropped from 65% to 42% over Q3, indicating significant user experience friction.

**Success Metrics**: Target 55% retention by Q1 through onboarding optimization and feature adoption.

**Solution Approach**:
- Implement progressive onboarding with value demonstration
- Add user journey analytics to identify drop-off points
- Create feature discovery system for advanced capabilities

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Week 1-2: Analytics implementation and baseline measurement
- Week 3-6: Onboarding redesign with A/B testing
- Week 7-8: Feature discovery integration and monitoring

**Confidence Level**: 7/10 (based on similar retention improvement initiatives)
```

#### Strategic Consultant Example

You: Should we expand into the European market?

Claude (Strategic Consultant style):
**Executive Summary**:
- European expansion presents â‚¬12M opportunity with 18-month ROI
- Regulatory complexity requires staged market entry approach
