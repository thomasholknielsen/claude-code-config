# Claude Code Configuration

## üîÑ Global Configuration & Continuous Improvement

### Agent Folder Configuration
When working with agent configurations or discovering new patterns, **always consider** whether this global CLAUDE.md should be updated.

### Commands Directory Configuration
When creating or modifying commands, **always evaluate** potential optimizations for:
1. Global CLAUDE.md configuration updates
2. Subagent selection and orchestration patterns
3. Command efficiency and reusability

## ü§ñ Subagent Optimization & Usage

### Performance Review Checklist
After using subagents, track and analyze:
- **Response Time**: Which agents are fastest for specific tasks?
- **Quality Output**: Which agents produce the best results?
- **Context Efficiency**: Which agents use context most effectively?
- **Combination Patterns**: Which agents work best together?

### Agent Selection Optimization
1. **Better Matching Logic**
   - Match tasks to specialized agents more accurately
   - Improve decision trees for agent selection
   - Document new agent combinations discovered through usage

2. **Parallel Execution Strategies**
   - Launch multiple agents simultaneously for independent tasks
   - Distribute work across appropriate agents
   - Pipeline optimizations for sequential workflows

3. **Context Reduction Techniques**
   - Use Task tool for complex searches to reduce context
   - Abstract repetitive patterns
   - Minimize unnecessary context passed to agents

## üìù Development Pattern Updates

### Review and Update Process
Track patterns that should be added to this configuration:

1. **New Agent Usage Patterns**
   - Discovered effective agent combinations
   - Multi-agent workflows that work well
   - Agent selection criteria improvements

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Better parallel execution strategies
   - Context management improvements
   - Tool usage optimizations discovered during agent work

3. **Common Issues & Solutions**
   - Recurring problems with specific agent types
   - Workarounds for agent limitations
   - Best practices for agent coordination

4. **Development Workflow Improvements**
   - New build/test command patterns
   - Better file handling strategies
   - Git workflow optimizations

### Command Pattern Analysis
Review commands for patterns that should be documented:
- **Recurring Workflows**: Commands used across multiple projects
- **Common Fixes**: Solutions to frequent problems
- **Best Practices**: Effective approaches discovered through usage
- **Tool Optimizations**: Better ways to use available tools

## üéØ Quality Standards

### Command Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each command should do one thing well
- **Composability**: Commands should work together effectively
- **Documentation**: Clear descriptions and usage examples
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and context usage
- **Reusability**: Design for use across different projects

### Review Checklist
Before finalizing commands or agent work:
- [ ] Could this use specialized subagents more effectively?
- [ ] Are there parallel execution opportunities?
- [ ] Would this pattern benefit other projects?
- [ ] Is the command/agent description clear and actionable?
- [ ] Have edge cases been considered?

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement Process

### Feedback Loop
1. **Monitor**: Track command/agent usage and effectiveness
2. **Analyze**: Identify patterns and bottlenecks
3. **Optimize**: Refine commands and agent usage
4. **Document**: Update this configuration
5. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on results

### Metrics to Track
- Command/agent execution frequency
- Success/failure rates
- Time to completion
- User satisfaction with results
- Context token usage

### Update Guidelines
When identifying improvements:
1. Document the pattern or optimization clearly
2. Test effectiveness across different scenarios
3. Propose specific additions to this CLAUDE.md
4. Consider impact on existing workflows
5. Update only after validation

## üìä Optimization Opportunities

### Current Focus Areas
1. **Agent Selection Logic**
   - Better matching of tasks to specialized agents
   - Improved decision trees for agent selection
   - New agent combinations discovered through usage

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Commands that could launch multiple agents simultaneously
   - Independent tasks that can be distributed
   - Pipeline optimizations for sequential workflows

3. **Context Reduction**
   - Commands that could use Task tool for searches
   - Repetitive patterns that could be abstracted
   - Unnecessary context passed to agents

### Continuous Improvement Notes
- Track patterns that appear across multiple projects
- Note inefficiencies in current configuration
- Document successful problem-solving approaches
- Maintain balance between completeness and conciseness

Remember:
- This configuration should evolve based on real usage patterns
- Commands are the bridge between user intent and agent execution
- Optimize to maximize the power of the subagent ecosystem while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness
