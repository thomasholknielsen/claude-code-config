# Claude Code Configuration - Command System Project

This file contains **project-specific** configuration for the Claude Code command system project, providing comprehensive instructions for CRUD operations on repository artifacts.

## üéØ Repository Overview

The Claude Code Command System is a comprehensive development automation system built on the **Agent Orchestra Framework**. This repository contains:

- **8 Agents**: 3 orchestrators + 5 workers for task coordination and execution
- **54 Commands**: Atomic operations organized across 13 categories
- **Complete Documentation**: User guides, technical docs, and visual workflows
- **Hooks System**: Cross-platform Python-based automation
- **MCP Integration**: Context7 and Playwright tools for enhanced capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Orchestra Framework

### Orchestrators (3 agents)
Coordinate complex, multi-step tasks and delegate to workers:

1. **implementation-orchestrator** - Coordinates sequential code changes ensuring consistency and preventing conflicts
2. **task-orchestrator** - General task coordinator that analyzes complexity and spawns appropriate specialized workers
3. **research-orchestrator** - Coordinates parallel information gathering across multiple sources and domains

### Workers (5 agents)
Execute specific functions with focused responsibilities:

1. **reviewer** - Specialized code review agent performing parallel quality, security, and design checks
2. **documenter** - Specialized documentation agent creating and maintaining all forms of technical documentation
3. **code-writer** - Focused code generation specialist using slash commands for structured operations
4. **bug-fixer** - Specialized debugging and bug resolution agent using fix-focused slash commands
5. **test-writer** - Specialized test creation and maintenance agent using test-focused slash commands
### Agent Coordination Patterns

**Use orchestrators for:**
- Complex tasks requiring planning and coordination
- Multi-step workflows with dependencies
- Tasks requiring parallel execution
- Cross-domain work requiring multiple workers

**Use workers for:**
- Single-responsibility atomic operations
- Specific expertise areas (coding, testing, documentation)
- Tasks that can be executed independently
- Operations that don't require coordination

### Command Design Principles

**Atomic Operations**: All commands (except workflows) are atomic, single-purpose operations that can be:
- Used directly by Claude Code users
- Called by orchestrators for complex workflows
- Executed by subagents as part of larger tasks
- Combined with other commands for sophisticated automation

**Clear Responsibility**: Each command has one primary function and clear expected outcomes.

**Integration Ready**: Commands include integration points showing how they work with other commands.

## üîå MCP Integration

### Context7 MCP - External Documentation
Provides access to current library and framework documentation:

**Tools Available:**
- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Map package names to documentation IDs
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Fetch current documentation content

**Used By:**
- **research-orchestrator**: For gathering current best practices
- **documenter**: For up-to-date documentation standards
- **code-writer**: For current API patterns and implementations
- **reviewer**: For latest security practices and guidelines
- **bug-fixer**: For known issue patterns and solutions

**Commands Enhanced:**
- `/docs:extract-external` - Primary Context7 integration command
- `/docs:api` - Current API documentation standards
- `/review:security` - Latest OWASP guidelines and vulnerabilities
- `/analyze:dependencies` - Current security advisories
- `/implement` - Framework-specific best practices

### Playwright MCP - Browser Automation
Provides comprehensive browser automation capabilities for testing and UI work:

**Tools Available:**
- Navigation: `navigate`, `navigate_back`, `tabs`
- Interaction: `click`, `type`, `hover`, `drag`, `select_option`
- Analysis: `snapshot`, `take_screenshot`, `console_messages`
- Forms: `fill_form`, `file_upload`
- Advanced: `evaluate`, `wait_for`, `network_requests`

**Integration Patterns:**
- UI testing automation
- Web application analysis
- Visual regression testing
- User interaction simulation
- Performance monitoring

## üåê Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Python-Based Hooks
All automation scripts are Python-based for cross-platform compatibility:

**Supported Platforms:**
- macOS (primary development)
- Windows (full compatibility)
- Linux (full compatibility)

**Hook Implementation:**
- Use `pathlib.Path` for all file operations
- Use `Path.home()` for user directory references
- Cross-platform environment variable handling
- No shell-specific scripts or commands

**Example Cross-Platform Pattern:**
```python
from pathlib import Path

# User-agnostic path handling
logs_dir = Path.home() / '.claude' / 'logs'
script_dir = Path(__file__).parent if '__file__' in globals() else Path.home() / '.claude' / 'scripts'
```

### User-Agnostic Design
All paths and configurations work regardless of username:
- Use `~/.claude/` instead of `/Users/specific-user/.claude/`
- Scripts detect their location dynamically
- No hardcoded user directories
- Portable configuration across systems

## üîê Security & Permission Guidelines

### Critical Git Operations Constraint
**MANDATORY**: Only `/git/*` commands can perform Git operations.

- **All other agents/commands**: Must use SlashCommand tool to delegate Git operations
- **Explicit consent required**: All Git operations outside `/git/*` must ask user permission
- **Agent limitation**: Agents cannot call Git commands directly
- **Enforcement**: Use SlashCommand tool for all Git delegation

### Permission Configuration
Located in `settings.json`:

**MCP Tools Allowed:**
- Context7: `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`, `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`
- Playwright: All browser automation tools (`mcp__playwright__*`)

**Security Protections:**
- Block access to secrets: `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, credentials
- Restrict dangerous operations: `rm -rf`, `sudo`, network tools
- Allow safe development operations: npm/yarn commands, standard Git ops

## üîß Development Standards

### Command Development

**Required Format** (follow `docs/command-template.md`):
```markdown
---
description: "Single clear sentence describing command purpose"
category: "folder_name"
agent: "primary-agent-from-orchestra"
tools: ["Tool1", "Tool2"]
complexity: "simple|moderate|complex"
---

# Command: {Action Verb} {Object}

## Purpose
Single sentence describing primary function.

## Usage
/{category}:{command-name} [arguments]

## Process
1. Step 1: Clear action
2. Step 2: Next action
3. Step 3: Final outcome

## Agent Integration
- **Primary Agent**: agent-name - role description

## Examples
[Real usage examples]
```

### Agent Development

**Agent Requirements:**
- **Single Responsibility**: One clear, focused purpose
- **No Overlap**: Must not duplicate existing agent functionality
- **Orchestra Compliance**: Follow orchestrator/worker pattern
- **Model Selection**: Opus for orchestrators, Sonnet for workers
- **Tool Integration**: Use SlashCommand for delegation, direct tools for execution

**Required YAML Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: "Clear description of agent purpose"
color: color-name
model: opus|sonnet
tools: ["Tool1", "Tool2"]
---
```

### Spec-Kit Integration

When `.specify/` folder exists, commands automatically:
- Reference `spec.md` for requirements validation
- Check `plan.md` for architectural alignment
- Verify `tasks.md` for completion criteria
- Validate `contracts/` for API compliance
- Align work with current feature context

This ensures all development work stays aligned with planned features.
