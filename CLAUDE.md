### Command Design Principles

**Atomic Operations**: All commands (except workflows) are atomic, single-purpose operations that can be:

- Used directly by Claude Code users
- Recommended by strategic specialists for complex workflows
- Informed by technical specialist guidance as part of larger tasks
- Combined with other commands for sophisticated automation

**Clear Responsibility**: Each command has one primary function and clear expected outcomes.

**Integration Ready**: Commands include integration points showing how they work with other commands.

## üîå MCP Integration

### Context7 MCP - External Documentation

Provides access to current library and framework documentation:

**Tools Available:**

- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Map package names to documentation IDs
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Fetch current documentation content

**Used By:**

- **research-analysis-specialist**: For advisory guidance on gathering current best practices
- **documenter**: For advisory guidance on up-to-date documentation standards

### Playwright MCP - Browser Automation

Provides comprehensive browser automation capabilities for testing and UI work:

**Tools Available:**

- Navigation: `navigate`, `navigate_back`, `tabs`
- Interaction: `click`, `type`, `hover`, `drag`, `select_option`
- Analysis: `snapshot`, `take_screenshot`, `console_messages`
- Forms: `fill_form`, `file_upload`
- Advanced: `evaluate`, `wait_for`, `network_requests`

**Integration Patterns:**

- UI testing automation
- Web application analysis
- Visual regression testing
- User interaction simulation
- Performance monitoring

## üåê Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Python-Based Hooks

All automation scripts are Python-based for cross-platform compatibility:

**Supported Platforms:**

- macOS (primary development)
- Windows (full compatibility)
- Linux (full compatibility)

**Hook Implementation:**

- Use `pathlib.Path` for all file operations
- Use `Path.home()` for user directory references
- Cross-platform environment variable handling
- No shell-specific scripts or commands

**Example Cross-Platform Pattern:**

```python
from pathlib import Path

# User-agnostic path handling
logs_dir = Path.home() / '.claude' / 'logs'
script_dir = Path(__file__).parent if '__file__' in globals() else Path.home() / '.claude' / 'scripts'
```bash

### User-Agnostic Design

All paths and configurations work regardless of username:

- Use `~/.claude/` instead of `/Users/specific-user/.claude/`
- Scripts detect their location dynamically
- No hardcoded user directories
- Portable configuration across systems

## üîê Security & Permission Guidelines

### Critical Git Operations Constraint

**MANDATORY**: Only `/git/*` commands can perform Git operations.

- **All other agents/commands**: Must use SlashCommand tool for Git operations (main thread executes)
- **Explicit consent required**: All Git operations outside `/git/*` must ask user permission
- **Agent limitation**: Agents cannot call Git commands directly
- **Enforcement**: Use SlashCommand tool for all Git delegation

### Permission Configuration

Located in `settings.json`:

**MCP Tools Allowed:**

- Context7: `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`, `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`
- Playwright: All browser automation tools (`mcp__playwright__*`)

**Security Protections:**

- Block access to secrets: `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, credentials
- Restrict dangerous operations: `rm -rf`, `sudo`, network tools
- Allow safe development operations: npm/yarn commands, standard Git ops

## üîß Development Standards

### Command Development

**Required Format** (follow templates):

- **Atomic commands**: Use `templates/command.md`
- **Workflow commands**: Use `templates/command-workflow.md`

**Required frontmatter fields**:
- `description`: Single clear sentence describing command purpose
- `argument-hint`: Parameter guidance for CLI
- `category`: Command category folder name
- `tools`: Array of Claude Code tools used
- `complexity`: simple | moderate | complex
- `allowed-tools`: Permission specification (e.g., `Tool1, Tool2, Bash(command:*)`)

**Template Selection**:
- Use base template (`templates/command.md`) for atomic, single-purpose operations
- Use workflow template (`templates/command-workflow.md`) for commands that orchestrate other slash commands using SlashCommand tool

**Example Format** (base template):

```markdown
---
description: "Single clear sentence describing command purpose"
argument-hint: "[arg1] [--flag=value]"
category: "folder_name"
tools: ["Tool1", "Tool2"]
complexity: "simple|moderate|complex"
allowed-tools: Tool1, Tool2, Bash(command:*)
---

# Command: {Action Verb} {Object}

## Purpose
Single sentence describing primary function.

## Usage
/{category}:{command-name} $ARGUMENTS

## Process
1. Step 1: Clear action
2. Step 2: Next action
3. Step 3: Final outcome

## Agent Integration
- **Primary Agent**: agent-name - role description

## Examples
[Real usage examples with $ARGUMENTS]
```bash

### Agent Development

**Agent Requirements:**

- **Single Responsibility**: One clear, focused purpose
- **No Overlap**: Must not duplicate existing agent functionality
- **Specialist Compliance**: Follow analysis/execution specialist pattern
- **Model Selection**: Opus for analysis specialists, Sonnet for execution specialists
- **Tool Integration**: Use SlashCommand for delegation, direct tools for execution

**Required YAML Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: "Clear description of agent purpose"
color: color-name
model: opus|sonnet
tools: ["Tool1", "Tool2"]
---
```

### Spec-Kit Integration

When `.specify/` folder exists, commands automatically:

- Reference `spec.md` for requirements validation
- Check `plan.md` for architectural alignment
- Verify `tasks.md` for completion criteria
- Validate `contracts/` for API compliance
- Align work with current feature context

This ensures all development work stays aligned with planned features.

## üîÑ CRUD Operations Guide

### üö® TODO File Location Constraint

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All TODO operations MUST use the standardized location:

- **Required Location**: `{project_root}/.claude/.todos/TODO.md`
- **Prohibited**: TODO files in any other location (project root, docs/, etc.)
- **Enforcement**: All `/to-do:*` commands validate and enforce this constraint
- **Rationale**: Centralized task tracking, consistent file management, prevents scattered TODO files

### Create Operations

**New Commands:**

1. Use command template from `docs/command-template.md`
2. Place in appropriate category folder: `commands/{category}/{name}.md`
3. Assign to existing Agent Specialist Framework agent
4. Include MCP tools if relevant (Context7 for docs, Playwright for UI)
5. Ensure atomic operation design

**New Agents:**

1. Follow agent template pattern from existing agents
2. Place in `agents/analysis-specialists/` or `agents/execution-specialists/`
3. Single responsibility only
4. Include model specification (Opus/Sonnet)
5. Document MCP tool usage if applicable

### Read Operations

**Understanding System:**

- Start with `README.md` for overview
- Use `docs/user-guide.md` for setup
- Review `docs/developer-guide.md` for architecture
- Check specific `docs/` files for detailed topics

**Command Discovery:**

- Browse `commands/` folders by category
- Check command YAML frontmatter for quick info
- Use `/help` in Claude Code for available commands

### Update Operations

**Modifying Commands:**

1. Follow existing template format
2. Update YAML frontmatter if changing agent/tools
3. Maintain atomic operation principle
4. Update related documentation if integration points change

**Modifying Agents:**

1. Maintain single responsibility
2. Update model specification if complexity changes
3. Keep MCP tool listings current
4. Update related command agent assignments

### Delete Operations

**Removing Commands:**

1. Check for dependencies in other commands
2. Update documentation referencing the command
3. Remove from any workflow sequences
4. Clean up empty categories if needed

**Removing Agents:**

1. Reassign all commands using the agent
2. Update Agent Specialist Framework documentation
3. Remove from workflow patterns
